# Welcome to `spaceapi.dev`

## What is it?

[SpaceAPI.dev](https://graph.spaceapi.dev) is a GraphQL API that provides a quick, small, and easy to understand schema for prototyping or learning how to build front-end applications using a GraphQL client.

Inspired by the [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev), this is centered around data about [NASA's Apollo Space Mission](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/) as it was built using the [Apollo GraphQL Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/).

## What's included?

The schema and data set may evolve over time but today offers:

- `Mission` -- A thing
- `Astronaut` -- A person
- `Image` -- A visual thing

## How can I get started?

Explore the API with the Apollo Explorer below or set your GraphQL URI to https://graph.spaceapi.dev in your own project and start querying.
