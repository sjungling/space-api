# Space API

Exploration of GraphQL with Apollo Server for creating a simple API for space program data starting with the Apollo program.

## Getting Started
```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Goals
Build a straightforward Apollo Server that flexes a lot of the capabilities of GraphQL and Apollo. Deployed as a serverless function, this will power a seperate front-end React application.
